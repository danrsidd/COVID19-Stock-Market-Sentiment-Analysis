# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_R

<em>Analyzing Twitter sentiments in R (sentiment bar plots, line plots, and word clouds)</em>

<em>Method and findings explained below also available at covidsentiments.com</em>

<em>All references used to develop this script can be found in the references section of covidsentiments.com</em>

This R script makes use of several libraries. Together these libraries and associated functions connect and authenticate a Twitter API connection, search for tweets with the given search parameters, and create a number of visualizations. ggplot2 was used to create all bar plot and line plot visualizations, while wordcloud was used to create all word cloud visualizations. Although this project is  situated in the context of COVID-19, simply changing search parameters (or potentially adding new parmeters) makes this script flexible for all sorts of visual Twitter sentiment analysis.
